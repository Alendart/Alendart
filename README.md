<h1>Hi there 👋, I'm Pawel Baraniak</h1>

###

<strong>I am a self-taught programmer. I have been learning independently since the beginning of 2022 and constantly try to develop myself. I started by learning C#, then made a huge course based on Javascript! 
Now, I'm a data analyst in a Polish company working in Power BI. In private time I try to code my first game!</strong>

🔭 I’m currently working on my 2D game!

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Data Science, and game development

👨‍💼 All my projects are here on GitHub
